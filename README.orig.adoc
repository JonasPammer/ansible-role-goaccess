is meant to be used not just internally.

[NOTE]
====
This role is part of https://github.com/JonasPammer/ansible-roles[
many compatible purpose-specific roles of mine].

The machine needs to be prepared.
In CI, this is done in `molecule/resources/prepare.yml`
which sources its soft dependencies from `requirements.yml`:
